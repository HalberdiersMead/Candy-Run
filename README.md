# Candy-Run
CIT 340
For my final game I would like to make a platformer similar to Rayman legends or Super Mario. I plan to call it Candy Run as the free assets that I have are from the free unity Platformer assets under CC0. I plan to continue off of my previous submission, if that is allowed, add more items such as;

•	Different abilities

•	Collectables

•	Score 

•	High score for a level

•	Respawn amount (lives not helathbar) 

•	Checkpoints

•	Enemies

•	Boss enemy

If there is time I would also like to implement; 

•	Level preview that shows what fraction of the collectables were gathered, i.e. 3 coins out of 4 collected

•	A gallery of enemies defeated

•	Gallery of powerups and what they do
